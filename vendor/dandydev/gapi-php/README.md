Gapi-php
================

This is an updated version of the Gapi-php class, for accessing Google Analytics accounts. It has updated API urls and I some fixed errors. Things that have changed:

* Made PHP5.3 compatible
* Put it under Composer package control
* Fixed the API endpoint URLs
* Fixed some bugs

The License is kept from the original. Please do realise that this class uses the _old_ method for authenticating (eg. username & password), which is _deprecated_. I cannot guarantee for how long Google will keep accepting requests in this way. If you have any comments, feel free to to mail me at: [daan@dandydev.net](mailto:daan@dandydev.net).
